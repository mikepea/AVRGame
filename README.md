AVRGame
=======
This project is for my 8x8 LED matrix game project. Please see the project WIKI on Github for more info on hardware/build etc

Requirements
============

Tone Library - http://code.google.com/p/rogue-code/downloads/list

NB: This needs updating for Arduino 1.x:
 - replace <wprogram.h> with <Arduino.h> in Tone.cpp
 - ditch 'include <pins_arduino.h>' in Tone.cpp
